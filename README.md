## Github Carpentries
***This repository is an exercise in learning how to use GitHub. I'm following the tutorial made available by the Smithsonian Institution called, ["Collaborating and sharing using GitHub without command line."](https://https://miketrizna.github.io/github-without-command-line/index.html)***


## Markdown
***Part of this exercise has been learning how to use Markdown.***

Save files as markdown files (.md) to utilize the formatting abilities.

To practice using Markdown, use the [The Carpentries CodiMD instance.](https://https://codimd.carpentries.org/OCiahPOvTI6zjgdu2qqTpA)

For more notes on markdown syntax, see the [Quickstart for writing on GitHub.](https://https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github)

```
Use the backtick ` character three times to offset code in it's own block in markdown.
Wrap the text in three backticks on separate lines before and after. 
Text formatted as code cannot be formatted in bold, underline, etc. 
```
>Use the > character to offset text as a block quote.


>When using the ** markup to display
**bold**
text, the asterisks must be next to the bold text with no space. The asterisks can be on the same line.
